Case example:
1. get the CT data (dicom FILE);
2. Download the code to your server with GPUsï¼›
3. Run the data.py to preprocess the raw CT data;
4. Download the model weights to the same server;
5. Put the model and weights to the same GPU;
6. Run the model file to put the data into the model (model3d.py);
7. predict the age!
